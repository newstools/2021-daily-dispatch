The market was also looted of all goods in stock and the full extent of damage is yet to be determined.” Zama said the torching has “set back our frontier for the delivery of water and sanitation services to our communities. And this will have an adverse affect on the delivery of  water to communities. We are still assessing the extent of damage and cost associated with this.” On Sunday, the municipality was already experiencing disruptions due to violent protests. “In view of the ongoing volatility in some parts of the district which has manifested into violent protests, residents are advised of a potential disruption to water and sanitation services. “Portable water tanker services have already been restricted from delivering water  to prevalent escalating acts of torching trucks.” TimesLIVE
