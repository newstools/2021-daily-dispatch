Surfer Jordy Smith has withdrawn from the Tokyo Olympics because of a knee injury  sustained in training five weeks ago, the SA Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) said  on Friday. The world No 7, considered a medal prospect, underwent surgery on his knee last month. In media interviews a week ago he spoke as if he would be competing in Tokyo, saying he was aiming for gold. His withdrawal leaves Bianca Buitendag as SAâ€™s only competitor in surfing, which is making its Games debut.
