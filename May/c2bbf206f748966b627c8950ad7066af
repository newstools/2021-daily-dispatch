A video of suspended ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule in the gym punching a bag is doing the rounds online, leaving many speculating over its context. The video was shared by EFF leader Julius Malema with the caption “48 hours for who?". It comes after Magashule was given a deadline to issue a public apology  to ANC leader  Cyril Ramaphosa and the party's structures for a suspension letter he wrote to Ramaphosa. Acting secretary-general Jessie Duarte said should Magashule fail to apologise within a time frame set, the ANC would institute disciplinary procedures in accordance with its constitution. A 48-hour time fame was, according to Duarte, not given by the ANC national executive committee (NEC) but rather a suggestion made by the party. “The suggestion was to request the SG to do so [apologise] within 48 hours ... although in the NEC body there was no timeline given. I just want to be clear about that. We’re hoping that within this week we will see the SG doing so,” she said. The deadline for the apology passed on Thursday.

Earlier this week he was “chess-shamed” by Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov, who pointed out that Magashule’s staged picture with a chess board showed he was making an illegal move. On social media, some joked that Magashule's boxing skills were also unlikely to worry US boxer Floyd Mayweather. Here is a snapshot of some of the reactions:
