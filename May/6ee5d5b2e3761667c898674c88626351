A cheetah has escaped from the Rietvlei Nature Reserve, apparently using a hole that smaller animals had dug under a fence. The City of Tshwane said an Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) team was in the process of trying to capture the cheetah, which escaped on Tuesday. The city warned visitors to  the nature reserve and residents in the surrounding areas to be vigilant and on the lookout for the animal. City spokesperson Selby Bokaba said it was not clear how the animal escaped, but  it was believed that it may have used a hole under the fence dug by smaller animals. “The fence is also electrified and cheetahs in the past never managed to exit the nature reserve. The perimeter  is patrolled daily and repairs are done regularly to prevent incidents like this,” he said. The cheetah was introduced by the EWT as part of its  conservation project to enhance cheetah numbers countrywide. Bokaba said after the first sighting of the cheetah outside the  reserve, it was reported to the  reserve's management by an adjacent landowner. “The management immediately launched an action to confirm the escape. Tracks and the animal sighting were confirmed on Tuesday this week. The cheetah has a neck collar that sends signals for tracing purposes,” he said. Bokaba said nearby landowners had  been notified and asked to report  sightings  to the nature reserve management and said a veterinarian was also on standby to tranquillise the animal. He said visitors  and members of the public could report any sighting of the cheetah by calling 082-322-5639. TimesLIVE
