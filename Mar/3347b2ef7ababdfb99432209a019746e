Best Care emergency medical service said the incident occurred at the Les-Marais Spar in Paul Kruger Street on Wednesday afternoon. “Best Care Emergency Medical Service attended an incident ... where a petrol bomb was allegedly thrown into the entrance of Spar, for an unknown reason and from an unknown person,” it said in a statement.
