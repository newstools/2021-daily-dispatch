US President Joe Biden lost his footing  on the stairs of Air Force One while boarding the plane. Biden tripped once and  recovered, but then  tripped again  and ended on all fours. He promptly got up unassisted and proceeded to board the aircraft. The president was reportedly on his way to Atlanta after the attack on beauty salons in the city last week. TimesLIVE
