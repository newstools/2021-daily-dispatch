The Hawks have arrested a 49-year-old East London woman over an allegedly fraudulent Road Accident Fund (RAF) claim amounting to R3m. Nosipho Cynthia Dlwathi was nabbed by the Serious Corruption Investigation team of the Hawks on Wednesday. On Friday, provincial Hawks spokesperson Captain Yolisa Mgolodela​ said Dlwathi had lodged a complaint at the East London Central police station in 2017. “She lodged a hit-and-run accident complaint where she claimed that her minor child sustained a broken leg in the incident. “She then made a claim of R3m from RAF through her lawyers,”  Mgolodela said. “On identifying some inconsistencies, a RAF representative reported the matter to the Hawks for investigation. “The investigation revealed that the child was [allegedly] never a hit-and-run victim but had instead sustained the injuries in 2015 while playing with another child at school.” Mgolodela added: “Sensing that her ploy was about to backfire, Dlwathi decided to make a confession and [allegedly] admitted to the crime. “Following her arrest, she made a brief appearance in the East London magistrate’s court on the same day and was released on  R500 bail. “The matter has been postponed  to 28 April 2021, when she is expected to appear in the East London Regional Court.” DispatchLIVE
