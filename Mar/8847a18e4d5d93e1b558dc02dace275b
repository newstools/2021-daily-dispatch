Eskom on Wednesday announced that there would be load shedding from 5pm until 11pm on Friday. The national power utility blamed the electrical generation capacity shortage of poor performance at the Kusile, Duvha and Tutukka power stations as well as service delays and breakdowns at other facilities. Eskom warned that there was a high probability of continued load shedding throughout the weekend. “Eskom has had to extensively utilise the emergency generation reserves, which are rapidly depleting.” “We have 6,212MW on planned maintenance, while another 11,217MW of capacity is unavailable due to the breakdowns and delays. This has led to our inability to supply the increasing demand,” Eskom said. DispatchLIVE
