The Nigerian-born University of Fort Hare academic who lied about his marital status to secure South African citizenship, has quit the institution. Edwin Ijeoma, a professor in the department of public administration was placed on precautionary suspension in October over allegations he was complicit in fraud committed against the university. The department of home affairs revoked his SA citizenship in 2009 after discovering Ijeoma was legally married in Nigeria when, as a doctoral student at Tukkies, he married a local woman and obtained naturalization based on that event. Over a decade later, Ijeomaâ€™s options ran out when the Bhisho high court confirmed the DHA acted correctly in revoking his citizenship. UFH vice-chancellor Professor Sakhela Buhlungu said Ijeoma was asked to provide reasons why his employment should not be cancelled in light of his illegal status in the country. He chose to resign in a letter dated February 26. Buhlungu said the university was still prosecuting Ijeoma internally and through the criminal justice system in respect of the alleged misappropriation of R5m belonging to the university. DispatchLIVE
