Bizana Pondo Chiefs continue to bolster their squad with the addition of former Chippa United and Bloemfontein Celtic ace Lerato Manzini on a short-term contract. Manzini has already started training with the club, with his contract ending at the conclusion of the season. Before joining The Hunters, he was with relegation rivals Cape Town Spurs. The 29-year-old is another marquee addition to Pondo Chiefs after the club acquired the services of head coach Clinton Larsen. He joins the likes of Masibusane Zongo, Sandile Zuke and Mondli Miya, who were all brought in to help save the club, which is at the bottom of the GladAfrica Championship table. The team are in trouble and  club chair Nkosinathi Mqokiyana said he believed Manzini’s experience could help them  save their status in the NFD. “We are delighted to welcome Lerato Manzini, his pedigree is a welcomed addition to the team,” he said. “He is someone from whom our young players will certainly draw inspiration. “We are confident  Manzini will fit  seamlessly into our team environment and will thrive with the unique culture we have.” Pondo Chiefs are left with 12 games in the season and will be hoping to unleash Manzini for the remainder of the campaign. After the international break,  Larsen’s side will take on his former employers, Polokwane City.
