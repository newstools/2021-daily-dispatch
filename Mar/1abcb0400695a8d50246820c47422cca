Tributes continue to pour in for the late Eastern Cape-born actress Noxolo “Noxee” Maqashalala. Maqashalala's body was found at her Honeydew home in Gauteng on Friday. Eastern Cape arts, culture, sport and recreation MEC Fezeka Nkomonye on Monday commended Maqashalala on being exemplary in the arts and described her death as “a blow to the industry”. “She was a symbol of hope to many aspiring young girls. She comes from the province and the dusty streets of KwaBhaca (formerly Mount Frere). She was a living example of how one’s part cannot determine where they are going in life,” said Nkomonye. “We particularly remember her when she acted as Viwe in the drama series Tsha Tsha which was filmed and produced in the Eastern Cape in Ngqushwa.” Nkomonye said her untimely death comes at a time when the department had been trying to find ways to bring back the glory of the province. “We send our heartfelt condolences to the family and the film sector at large,” she added. Family friend Senyukele Sihlobo told DispatchLIVE on Monday that the family was still awaiting toxicology and pathology reports. “We do not know yet as to what happened to Noxee. We are still waiting,” Sihlobo said. The 44-year-old actress will be laid to rest at her family home of Mpoza Village in KwaBhaca (formerly Mount Frere) on Friday. Police said at the weekend preliminary reports indicated that there was no foul play in the death of Maqashalala. Police spokesperson captain Balan Muthan told DispatchLIVE that when their team arrived at Maqashalala’s place, the door of her house was locked from inside. DispatchLIVE
