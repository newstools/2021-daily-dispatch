AbaThembu Prince Azenathi Dalindyebo says he has been vindicated by the Mthatha magistrate’s court decision to provisionally withdraw an assault case against him on Wednesday. In June last year, Babalo Papu,  right-hand man to Azenathi's estranged father King Buyelekhaya Dalindyebo,  opened a case of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and pointing a firearm. DispatchLIVE reported at the time that Papu had opened a case against eight people but only Azenathi was charged. The case was provisionally withdrawn as the state is not ready to prosecute. The king still faces a charge of assault from March last year, when he allegedly beat Azenathi at Bumbane Great Place about 50kms outside  Mthatha. Speaking to DispatchLIVE, Azenathi said his assertions of innocence had been proven by the latest court decision. “I had nothing to do with what happened to Mr Papu,” he said. The relationship between the king and his heir soured after Dalibyebo was released from prison on parole in December 2019 and infighting ensued over the regency as Azenathi had been serving as acting king of the AbaThembu. He had served four years of a 12-year sentence at the West Bank Prison in East London. He was found guilty of arson, kidnapping, and defeating the ends of justice. DispatchLIVE
