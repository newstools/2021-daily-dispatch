Ntuthuko Ntokozo Shoba, the alleged mastermind believed to have planned the murder of Tshegofatso Pule, his eight-months pregnant girlfriend, applied for bail in the Roodepoort magistrate's court on Monday. The alleged father of Puleâ€™s child was arrested on February 18  and faces charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder and defeating the ends of justice. He was implicated in the murder by the man who killed Pule, Muzikayise Malephane, who is serving a 20-year jail term. The state lawyers  argued on Monday  that his defence lawyers had not given  a good enough reason as to why Shoba should be granted bail. "Everyone knows about this case, look how full this room is - even the president knows about this case," said the state lawyer in a counter-argument. The defence  lawyer said Shoba's life could be in danger as he had received multiple voice notes containing  possible death threats, adding that  he would be safer out of custody. The state lawyer said  if his life was in danger, he would be safer in custody. The judgment has been postponed to Friday. TimesLIVE
