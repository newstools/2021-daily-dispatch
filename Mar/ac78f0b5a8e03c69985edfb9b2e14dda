A KwaBhaca businessman was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for illegal power connections on Tuesday. Sandile Ntombela, 34, owner of Zamdela Pty LTD, was convicted on charges of theft and fraud. Hawks provincial spokesperson Captain Yolisa Mgolodela said the Mthatha-based Hawks' serious commercial investigation team proved that Ntombela had been responsible for illegal power connections, since 2018, at a string of flats he owned at Badisana Location in KwaBhaca. “He continuously tempered with the power utility's infrastructure, resulting in Eskom losing over R178 000,” she said. Mgolodela said the Hawks arrested Ntombela in July 2019. He made a series of court appearances after he was initially granted bail of R10,000. The KwaBhaca regional court convicted Ntombela and sentenced him to 12 and eight years imprisonment, respectively for each count. The sentences will run concurrently. Ntombela's business was fined R20,000. DispatchLIVE
