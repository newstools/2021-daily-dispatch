Buffalo City Metro council elected ANC councillor Helen Neale-May as deputy mayor in a special council meeting on Tuesday. Neale-May, who was serving as a mayoral committee, headed the finance portfolio before her election.​ Last week, DispatchLIVE reported that Neale-May had been lined up to replace Zoliswa Matana, who succumbed to Covid-related complications in December.​ BCM chief whip Humphrey Maxegwana chaired the virtual meeting. Council had to go to a vote after two councillors were nominated. Helen Neale-May was up against DA councillor Sue Bentley. “I want to congratulate councillor Neale-May. I know that you have a lot of experience in local government and I know you will do as expected," said Maxegwana. DispatchLIVE
