It's all systems go for voter registration in the Buffalo City Metro this weekend,  the Electoral Commission (IEC) said in a statement on Friday. According to the IEC, registration will take place between Saturday and Sunday in Ward 20 “to fill a vacancy of ward councillor after the expulsion of the councillor by the corporate governance and traditional affairs MEC”. In January, Cogta MEC Xolile Nqatha expelled BCM councillor Ntombizodwa Gamnca, with immediate effect, for violating Municipal Systems Act. “The electoral commission is calling on residents in this ward to ensure they are registered and if not, they go and register in order to participate in the by-election that will be held on 21 April 2021. Voting stations within the affected ward will be open for registration from 8pm to 5pm on both days,” IEC said in a statement on Friday. “A reminder that in order to be able to vote you need to be a registered voter and to register you must bring your green bar-coded ID book, smart ID card or a valid temporary identity certificate with to the voting station. “Members of the public are assured that extensive Covid-19 protocols are being adhered to by the Electoral Commission to ensure the safety of their health while visiting the voting station​s.” It's a criminal offence for voters to register where they don't reside, IEC warned.
