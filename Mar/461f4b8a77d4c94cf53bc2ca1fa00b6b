Mzansi has gone for the jugular, attacking goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune and coach Gavin Hunt after Chiefs lost their last game of the month on Sunday night, finishing February without a single win. Twitter has been littered with videos of Khuneâ€™s blapses on the field after  Amakhosi were handed a 4-0 defeat by Wydad  Casablanca in the Champions League group match in Burkina Faso. Khune was outplayed on several occasions, raising the ire of Chiefs fans who have again called for his head. Loyalists put the blame on coach Hunt, hoping to offer a reprieve for their once-trusted goalie.
