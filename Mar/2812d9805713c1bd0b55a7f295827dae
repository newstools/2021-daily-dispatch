Nyameka Qongqo, 44, admitted to stealing millions from November 2012 to 2014 in her plea of guilty in the Mthatha high court last month. On Thursday, judge Richard Brooks meted out a 15-year-sentence for fraud and 10 years for money laundering. The sentences will run concurrently. Qongqo was initially charged with her sister, Thumeka, and ex-boyfriend Thobani Notshokovu. Last year, Notshokovu pleaded guilty and was subsequently sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with an option of R50,000. Thumeka pleaded not guilty and will be back in the dock on May 3.
