The public protector has found that the municipalities that banked with the now defunct VBS Mutual Bank acted improperly. In total, 15 local municipalities in Limpopo, the North West and Gauteng deposited about R1.6bn with VBS Mutual Bank, in contravention of the Municipal Finance Management Act (MFMA) and after being instructed not to do so by the National Treasury. “Makhado local municipality irregularly invested R155m  from 2016 to 2017 with VBS Mutual Bank. The investment resulted in the loss of more than R60m of public funds,” said  advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane during the release of 17 reports stemming from investigations her office conducted. Among the findings were: “These investments were made in violation of the provisions of section 13(1) of the Municipal Finance Management Act, the municipal investment regulations and the policies regulating investments by the municipalities. “The funds lost could have been used to improve service delivery to the communities,” Mkhwebane said. She said the conduct of the municipalities was improper. Mkhwebane said to remedy their conduct and maladministration, municipal managers of the municipalities should: “The Limpopo, North West and Gauteng MECs responsible for local government must submit regular reports to the director-general of the National Treasury with their comments, where appropriate, on the implementation of the remedial action above.” TimesLIVE
