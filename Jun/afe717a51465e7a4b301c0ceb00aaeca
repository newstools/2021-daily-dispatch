A microscopic organism has wriggled back to life and reproduced asexually after lying frozen in the vast permafrost lands of northeastern Siberia for 24,000 years. A view through a microscope shows a tiny, ancient animal called the bdelloid rotifer at an unknown location, in this still image taken from undated handout video footage. The microscopic organism was found by Russian scientists.
