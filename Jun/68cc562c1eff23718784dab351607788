Al Ahly head coach Pitso Mosimane had thousands in a frenzy on Twitter over the weekend with a cryptic message that some saw as shade directed at his former employer. “Some people are so poor, all that they have is money,” he tweeted. It isn’t clear what triggered the tweet which garnered more than 1,000 comments and 28,000 likes. Some believed it was a snub at Mamelodi Sundowns amid  rising tensions between  Mosimane and his former club. Others said it was unlikely, since he had left Sundowns “on good terms”. TimesLIVE reported that Mosimane’s representatives received a summons from Sundowns demanding to be paid back commission fees related to the coach. They said efforts to meet Sundowns owner Dr Patrice Motsepe were refused, and requests for a meeting with chairman Tlhopane Motsepe  were “met with silence”. Mosimane left the Pretoria club in September last year to join the Egyptian giants. Motsepe at the time wished him well, saying he had always expressed  support for Mosimane to coach in North Africa or for SA’s national team, Bafana Bafana. Mosimane’s tweet comes  weeks after some Mamelodi Sundowns fans hurled insults at  him before the match  against Al Ahly at Lucas Moripe Stadium in Pretoria. Sundowns reached out to the Egyptian team in a bid to ease  tension between the two sides. Here’s what fans had to say about the weekend tweet:
