In just one month, the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality paid out almost R50m in overtime claims and allowances. An eye-watering R27m was signed off for overtime pay and a further R20.3m for allowances in April. Almost R11m of the overtime expenditure went to safety and security employees, including metro police officers whose visibility — or lack thereof — after hours has been questioned by residents in recent months. The metro is already saddled with an annual wage bill of R3.1bn, a significant portion of its R13bn total budget.
