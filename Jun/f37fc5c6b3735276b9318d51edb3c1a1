A different type of participant dropped in on Pope Francis' general audience at the Vatican on Wednesday:  “Spider-Man”. A man dressed in a full, skin-tight, red, black and blue costume of the comic book character — including head cover — was sitting in a VIP section of the audience in the Vatican's San Damaso Courtyard. He sat quietly next to a priest dressed in black who appeared  unperturbed by the colourful character with big white eyes in the next seat. It was not immediately clear why “Spider-Man” had joined the audience. Of course SA is no stranger to seeing “Spider-Man” out and about in public — and entertaining audiences with his snazzy dance moves. Last month, several video clips emerged on social media showing a man garbed in the superhero outfit, doing the gwara gwara and vosho, much to the delight of his local “fans”. - Additional reporting by Khanyisile Ngcobo
