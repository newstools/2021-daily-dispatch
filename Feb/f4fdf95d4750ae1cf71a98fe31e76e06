Golfer Tiger Woods was in hospital on Tuesday after being involved in a single-vehicle accident in Los Angeles, police said. The vehicle sustained major damage and Woods was extricated from the wreck with the “jaws of life” by firefighters and paramedics, then transported to a local hospital by ambulance, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement. Police responded to a roll-over traffic collision at about 7.12am local time and said a traffic investigation was being conducted. The 45-year-old American had hosted the annual Genesis Invitational at the Riviera Country Club  at the weekend but did not compete because of ongoing issues with his surgically repaired back. Reuters
