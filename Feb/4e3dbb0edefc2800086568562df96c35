The late boxing icon Mzimasi Mnguni has been granted a provincial official funeral. This was revealed by government officials on Wednesday. Sports dignitaries and government officials converged at the home of  Mnguni in East London to pay their respects to him. Mnguni, 73, died last weekend following a long illness. His death has sparked a flood of tributes with his drive-by memorial service on Wednesday attended by scores of people, some of which had to stand in the streets to observe Covid-19 regulations. Mnguni produced a horde of world and national champions who were also present at his send-off. Eastern Cape sports, recreation, arts and culture MEC Fezeka Nkomonye revealed that Mnguni's funeral has been granted provincial state funeral category two by President Cyril Ramaphosa. “We are grateful to the president for honouring Mr Mnguni this way,” said Nkomonye. “He is leaving a legacy not only in boxing but in sport in general. Through his work plenty of kids were spared life on drugs and became better people. People may see him as a boxing man but to us he made a sterling contribution to the EC society at large. “ Mnguni will have two funeral services with the first being held at the Presbyterian Church of Southern Africa in Gompo on Saturday. The second will be held at his eMaZotshweni location in Alice on Sunday. Speakers took turns to speak glowingly about the man once dubbed “ Mr Boxing”. Eastern Cape Boxing Promoters Association also paid homage to the man who had numerous nicknames when he was a trainer, manager and promoter. “His numerous nicknames underlined the influence he made to all of us,” said chair Thando Zonke.
