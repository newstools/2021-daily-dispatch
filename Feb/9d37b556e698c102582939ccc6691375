At least 200 health-care workers who will be vaccinating community members in Limpopo will travel with security guards to protect the vaccines. This was revealed in Polokwane yesterday by Limpopo health MEC Phophi Ramathuba  when she detailed the province’s Covid-19 vaccine rollout plan. “We are going to allocate 200 vaccinators who are professional nurses and will  allocate an enrolled nurse and a security guard to protect the  vaccines. We  already  have 169 vaccinators  in training. We might start vaccinating the first health workers on February 15,” she said. Ramathuba said each vaccinator will target about 50 people a day and more vaccinators will be needed when approaching phases 2 and 3.
