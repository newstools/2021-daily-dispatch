An East London businessman was allegedly kidnapped in Butterworth, where he runs a workshop, on Thursday afternoon. Schalk van der Merwe, 42, was allegedly forced into the back of his white Audi A3 in full view of his staff at about 5pm. He owns Kei Truck and Tractor. His friend Basil Duvenage said Van der Merwe was allegedly kidnapped by six armed suspects in a Toyota Quantum. “I'm sure one of them left in the Toyota Quantum and the other five in his car,” Duvenage said. He said a car similar to his friend's was spotted around Butterworth after the incident took place. “There were five guys in it, but the guy did't see my friend,” Duvenage said. On early Friday morning, Duvenage told DispatchLIVE that there had been no new developments that he was aware of. He said he was hoping that Van der Merwe, a married father of two, was unharmed.
