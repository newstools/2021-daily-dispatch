Kaizer Chiefs’ preparations for the start of the group stages of the Caf Champions League have been thrown into complete disarray after it emerged that they are yet to be issued with visas to enter Morocco. Chiefs face Wydad Casablanca away from home on Saturday and they are due to leave for the North African country on Wednesday night. They are expected to return  to SA on Monday. But hours before their expected departure‚ the club still has no idea  whether they will indeed travel to Morocco. “After the draw and the fixture announcement‚ Kaizer Chiefs made all the necessary arrangements to travel‚ including booking flights‚ securing accommodation‚ submission of visa applications and everything  required for the trip‚” Chiefs said in a statement on Wednesday. “Following the submission of the application for visas‚ the club has been in constant communication with Caf‚ the Moroccan Embassy in SA‚ South African Embassy in Morocco‚ Safa‚ Wydad Casablanca‚ the Moroccan Football Association and the department of international relations and co-operation  (Dirco) to ensure that the application for visas is processed and approved.” Safa CEO  Tebogo Motlanthe told TimesLIVE on Tuesday morning that they are  working on resolving the issue. “We are aware of the issue regarding Kaizer Chiefs and the association is working on it‚” said Motlanthe without going into details of their intervention. Chiefs said they would send a delegation to the Moroccan embassy on Wednesday in a bid to seek clarity and also request for the visas to be issued on time so that the team can catch their flight. “Wydad did confirm that they are awaiting confirmation from their ministry of health to grant Kaizer Chiefs special permission to enter the country because SA is on the list of countries  banned from entering Morocco due to the high numbers of  Covid-19 infections. No response has been received by Wydad or Kaizer Chiefs to this effect.”
