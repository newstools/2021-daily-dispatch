Former president Jacob Zuma and the man who led the chants for him to “pay back the money” over his Nkandla home are plotting a weekend meeting, seemingly at that same location. EFF leader Julius Malema on Wednesday sent a tweet to the former president's official Twitter account, asking if they could “please have tea urgently”. This comes just two days after Zuma said he would defy a Constitutional Court order that he appear before — and answer questions at — the state capture commission later this month. About four hours later, Zuma replied, extending an invitation to his once bitter political rival. “Thobela Moshabi. I have seen your request to share a cup of tea. As you know, Nkandla village is home for me and that is where my time is spent these days. Tea I have plenty of, you are more than welcome to come over for a cup,” he said. Malema suggested that he would take up that invitation “possibly this weekend”. “I will take it further with your young man Mzwandile Masina  for final details. Thank you for accepting my request promptly. It is in the best interest of our country,” he said. For his part, Masina appeared to indicate that the meeting was going ahead — but didn't  provide specifics. “Tea session of President Jacob Zuma and Julius Malema will be interesting and I’m sure the two men who contributed to the constitutional being of SA will provide a grate insight of how mature our democracy has become. Count down starts now, keep you posted!!!!" he said. TimesLIVE
