Two children have died and a third is still being searched for after they were trapped underground while playing on Monday afternoon. The two bodies were recovered from the collapsed sand alongside the N2 at the Borcherds Quarry Road intersection in Nyanga, Cape Town. Emergency services rushed to the scene to try  to rescue the children. The N2 was closed as rescue teams conducted their search. Cape Town fire and rescue services spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said that the bodies of the two children were retrieved shortly after 6pm, about three hours after the incident occurred at 3.10pm. The search for the third child's body was still ongoing, with the fire and rescue services and the K9 unit active at the scene. It is believed that the three children were trapped underground after sand they were playing in collapsed on them. Carelse said an emergency call was received at 3.10. “Gugulethu and Mitchells Plain fire crews were dispatched to the scene.  Technical rescue teams from Roeland Street and Metro EMS were dispatched,” said Carelse. TimesLIVE
