The boxing world was plunged into mourning on Saturday morning after the news broke of the death of boxing icon Mzimasi Mnguni in an East London hospital. He was 73 years old. Mnguni popularly known as Bra Mzi had been battling with health problems since a heart attack in 2014, which left him in a wheelchair. His health deteriorated further over the years and he was in and out of hospital. In the last two months, he has permanently been in hospital where he died at 6.20am on Saturday morning. His brother Sihle Mnguni said Mnguni passed away on the day the family was burying their sister. “Right now I am attending a funeral of my sister and if Bra Mzi was well he would be here as well,” he said. Mnguni made history by becoming the trainer who produced the most world boxing champions in the country. His boxers include former world champions Welcome Ncita, who is the first Eastern Cape boxer to win a world title, Vuyani Bungu, who holds the record for most world title defences by an SA boxer, Mbulelo Botile, Zolani Petelo, Masibulele Hawk Makepula, Lindi Memani, Zolani Marali, Mhikiza Myekeni and horde of national champions. Funeral arrangements are yet to be announced. DispatchLIVE
