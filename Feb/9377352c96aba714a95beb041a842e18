The Protea magistrate's court in Soweto was forced to postpone all court cases  on Wednesday after going five weeks without water due to a plumbing problem. All public and staff toilets in the court building have  been locked while about a dozen mobile toilets have been brought in for temporary relief. When Sowetan visited the court on Wednesday, there were nine temporary mobile toilets lined up on a grass patch in front of the court building, while five others were stationed behind the building.
