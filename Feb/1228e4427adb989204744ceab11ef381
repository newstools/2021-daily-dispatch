Pitso Mosimane has not ruled out the possibility of coaching Bafana Bafana again in the future. Al Ahly's coach, who is making great strides internationally and raising the SA flag high, said his return to the national team was possible. Addressing the issue in the On The Whistle podcast, Mosimane said he was not sure when his return to team would be. He said there was a lot of football work that needed to be done in the national team by the football federation, including in player development. “There’s a phrase we have in SA that says ‘once a Bafana, always a Bafana’, Yes, it is possible, but when, I’m not sure,” said Mosimane. “SA is my country. I always carry my flag and I never forget where I come from. That is my country and they gave me the opportunity to be here.” The former Sundowns coach was an assistant coach for the 2010 World Cup in SA, where Bafana Bafana failed to make it out of the group stages. In July 2010, he was appointed as Bafana Bafana coach, a position he occupied until June 2012. Hailed a living legend by many football fans, Mosimane is regarded as the most successful manager in SA football history, winning five Absa Premiership titles with Sundowns. He's had an impressive start with the Egyptian giants, winning 18 and drawing four of the 23 matches he’s coached Al Ahly to date. On Monday, Mosimane tasted his first  loss when the team was defeated 2-0 by European champions Bayern Munich in the Fifa Club World Cup semi-final in Qatar. Taking to Twitter post-match, Mosimane said the result had left him feeling "sick". “Not the results we wanted. We will have to improve on many aspects. Football at the World Cup level will always show you still have a lot of work to do. “Most especially when you are playing against champions of Europe. Tasted my first loss, so sick.”
