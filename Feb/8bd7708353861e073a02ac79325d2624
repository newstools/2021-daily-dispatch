Bizana Pondo Chiefs captain Zamile Daniels blamed the team’s lack of concentration for their 1-0 soccer defeat to Royal AM at the Chatsworth Stadium on Wednesday. Pondo Chiefs conceded a goal in the first 10 minutes as Tshepo Liphoko gave Royal AM the lead and they held on to it for the rest of the match. The loss moved  coach Tshepo Motsoeneng’s side to the bottom of the GladAfrica Championship log. “The game was not bad, but what we lacked was concentration,” Daniels said. “The first 10 minutes of the game was when we should have concentrated, they pressed us. “They pressed us because they wanted a goal. They knew our legs were not fresh because we just recently had a game. As the first 45 minutes of the game progressed they dropped the pace. “From there onwards it was better. They parked the bus and we were able to play in their half. In the last 45 minutes they would catch us on the transition. “We should have converted our chances but it was one of those days.” Daniels took over the captain’s armband for the day from regular skipper Musa Bilankulu. It was a crowning moment for the young defender who has been with the club for some time, playing four seasons in the ABC Motsepe League before their promotion to the  GladAfrica Championship. “It’s always a great pleasure to be selected as captain,” the 24-year-old said. “I believe the technical team see leadership skills in me, they have shown belief in me. “I’ve been here for some time. This also pushes me to encourage the youngsters and show them it can happen. I want them to learn from me as I have learned from those who are older than me.” The Hunters will travel to Bethlehem to face Free State Stars in their next match. Daniels  believes that a point away from home will be a good result. “We are playing away, it’s going to be difficult, we need to prepare,” he said. “We are going there to collect a point, away to Free State Stars is not going to be easy but we have to soldier on.” DispatchLIVE
