King William's Town ground to a halt on Thursday when Buffalo City Metro workers burned tyres and blocked roads. When DispatchLIVE arrived, the crowd had already dispersed but left the town littered with debris. Bins were emptied into the streets and fires made from burning tyres. Once the crowds had dispersed, armoured police vehicles patrolled the area while dodging fires in the middle of the road. DispatchLIVE
