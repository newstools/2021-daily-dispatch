The liquor industry heaved a sigh of relief when President Cyril Ramaphosa eased lockdown level 3 regulations on Monday evening — with the booze and beach bans lifted. On Tuesday a Mthatha tavern operator, who had to fork out thousands of rands from his pockets to pay his three employees during December and January,  gave the eagerly-awaited move the thumbs-ups. Embracing the relaxed regulations, Zamikhaya Maziko, 31,  cleaned his Hola Club tavern in Maqhinebeni village while preparing to reopen it. “I had to use my savings to keep my business afloat and support the family while I had no income. The festive season would have been the perfect time to save money,”  he said. “We don't just sell alcohol. We also host pool tournaments where young people come to play and make money to keep them off the streets. The business suffered a huge blow.” When the resurgence of Covid-19 cases began late last year, taverns and other social gatherings were believed be among the super-spreaders. In light of the perception, Maziko urged roleplayers to play by the rules in order to help curb the spread of the virus. “We do not want to return to another ban,” he added. Viwe Mtengwane, a happy customer, played pool on his phone when the tavern was closed. “I am happy the tavern is open now. That means I will play my pool with other people but adhering to the regulations as well,” he said. “I am also glad that people who work in the liquor industry will now return to work. It was hard to see my neighbour suffering because of the alcohol ban.” DispatchLIVE
