Police recovered an unlicensed firearm and arrested three suspects after a high-speed chase and shoot-out on the R63 near Bhisho Hospital on Friday. The drama unfolded when police drove past Bhisho Park, where they spotted a stationary Toyota Tazz with a driver and a passenger in the back seat. A third suspect immediately jumped into the back seat when he saw the police  stopping. “The suspects’ vehicle then sped off and drove down the R63  towards Komga,” said police spokesperson Capt Khaya Tonjeni. “The members gave chase and  fired three warning shots in an attempt to stop the escapees, but the vehicle did not stop. All of a sudden the third suspect pulled out a firearm and fired  towards the officers. Police retaliated and a shoot-out began.” ​​ Tonjeni said the suspect who had fired at the police jumped out and ran towards Bhisho Hospital and an officer chased after him. The suspect pretended to  fall but the officer  noticed that he was throwing the firearm away. “The officer managed to arrest the suspect and recovered a .38 special revolver with three rounds of ammunition,” he said. “The second passenger  was grazed on his right shoulder by a bullet and   treated at Bhisho Hospital and released.” ​None of the police officers sustained any injuries.
