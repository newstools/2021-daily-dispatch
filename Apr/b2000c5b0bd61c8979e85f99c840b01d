The case of a 14-year-old girl arrested in connection with the assault on schoolgirl Lufuno Mavhunga has been postponed to Thursday. The teenager, who made her first court appearance  on Friday, appeared again in the Thohoyandou children’s magistrate’s court on Tuesday for her bail application. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson in Limpopo Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi said the matter will be rolled over  for a new presiding officer. “The matter of a child in conflict with the law could not continue today in the Thohoyandou children‘s court,” she said. “At this stage, the matter will be heard by a neutral chair to ensure a power balance between the interest of the state and the interest of the child. The previous magistrate knows the facts of the preliminary inquiry. “The case will be rolled over to  April 22  to have a new presiding officer, and the docket should be referred to the office of the director of public prosecutions to receive the certificate.” News of Mavhunga’s death made headlines after the 15-year-old took her own life by overdosing on pills last week just hours after being beaten by another pupil. Footage of the incident was shared on social media. It showed Mavhunga being repeatedly slapped in the face by the perpetrator. Malabi-Dzhangi said the  teenager remains in a youth centre. She was arrested last Wednesday. Mavhunga was buried in Limpopo on Saturday. TimesLIVE
