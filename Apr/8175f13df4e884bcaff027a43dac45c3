The state capture commission chaired by deputy chief justice Ramond Zondo is expecting  to hear Transnet-related evidence from the state entity's former CFO Anoj Singh on Thursday. Later  in the day, former public enterprises minister Lynne Brown is schedule to give Denel-related evidence. On Wednesday, inspector-general of intelligence Isaac Dintwe testified at the commission. He stated that he believes that a “parallel vetting structure” was established by the State Security Agency (SSA) to deal with opponents of the state capture project. And for this Dintwe fingered two top spooks — former special ops boss Thulani Dlomo and erstwhile spy boss Arthur Fraser.
