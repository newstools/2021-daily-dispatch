A rogue electrical pulse that causes such a severe overload on homes that fizzy drinks in refrigerators have been exploding, has put the city at the centre of yet another  scandal. Ratepayers’ associations were up in arms this week over what they called “sloppy and dangerous” wiring work being carried out by a “tenderpreneur”, who won a R25 million deal to install new mini-transformers damaged by the recent on-off impact of load-shedding. Gompo1994cc was awarded the highly competitive tender via a deviation which bypassed the three-tiered bidding system two weeks ago, and since then  top-brand electrical appliances, such as hairdryers, kettles, toasters, barbers clippers, and even a prescription-based device to enhance sexual performance, started to “glow and blow”, said a reliable source who was being treated for injuries by a city urologist. The local ratepayers forum declined to comment for fear of being victimised “with another electricity fee hike”, but a source close to the forum said they had received scores of reports of smoking, flaming implements. The municipality said an inspection of the transformers found one box had been wired upside down. They also said they were aware of the random pulses in the city network which had caused minor damage to a number of traffic department speed cameras, and had destroyed a few computers in the supply chain management offices. “Even the mayor’s coffee machine caught fire, but the fire department arrived in a few seconds and managed to put out the fire without any major damage.” DispatchLIVE was reliably told that the machine was a compact espresso machine manufactured in Milan at a cost of R33,995 and that 10kg of Volcanika Kenyan AA coffee beans costing R997 a 500g bag also went up in smoke. “Yoh! That was the most aromatic fire ever, and we have put out a lot of blazing cannabis,” quipped one firefighter. DispatchLIVE
