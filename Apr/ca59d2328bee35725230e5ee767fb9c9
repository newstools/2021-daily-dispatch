Walter Sisulu University has shut down three campuses after violent protests. WSU spokesperson Yonela Tukwayo confirmed the disruption of institutional operations and damage to university property due to student protest action at the university's Buffalo City, Butterworth and Mthatha campuses. Tukwayo said the protests started on Friday. “Through a memorandum submitted by Buffalo City and Butterworth Campus student bodies; they have expressed dissatisfaction with delays and issues pertaining to admissions and registration,” she said. Other grievances include financial exclusion, incorrect academic results, NSFAS allowances, accommodation, certificates and transport allowance. “As things stand, at least three of the university’s four campuses have had their operations disrupted by students,” said Tukwayo. “Management requests for calm and order on all campuses and for students to use the open channels of communication and to engage management. WSU condemns the damage caused by some striking students.” Attempts to get comment from the student representative council (SRC) have been unsuccessful so far.​ DispatchLIVE
