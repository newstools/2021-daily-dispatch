Controversial coach Luc Eymael appears headed for the exit at Chippa United on Wednesday with the club once again seemingly bowing to public pressure. The Belgian was appointed as a “technical advisor” on Monday which triggered public and political outrage. But on Wednesday morning, a source at the club told the Herald that Eymael is on his way out. Club media liaison Sisa Majola would not confirm or deny the news merely saying: “The management together with the technical team will have a meeting this morning to discuss a way forward.” As in December when Chippa announced Eymael to replace fired coach Lehlohonolo Seema, his appointment had drawn widespread condemnation because of his “racist and offensive remarks” made at a previous club. In December, he lasted only 24 hours in his position. This is a developing story. HeraldLIVE
