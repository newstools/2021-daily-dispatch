The University of Fort Hare has suspended two senior officials who are being probed over allegations of “serious misconduct”. Financial aid, fees and bursaries manager Alberto Lai-Wing and financial aid and bursaries head of department Grant Skinnette have been suspended pending the outcomes of the investigations. UFH chief financial officer Charles Matumba made the announcement in a communique to staff and students on Friday. “While the investigations are taking place, the university is disinclined to disclose in detail the nature of the allegations against these staff members in order to avoid prejudicing their rights,” Matumba said in the memo. “It should be noted that at this stage we are investigating allegations, which may or may not lead to disciplinary proceedings.” Matumba said the university community would be kept in the loop about latest developments of the probe. “When appropriate, and without infringement on the rights of these staff members, the university will issue a further statement on the outcome of the investigations,” he said. This is a developing story. DispatchLIVE
