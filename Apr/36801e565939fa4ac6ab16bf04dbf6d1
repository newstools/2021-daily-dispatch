The jury is out on whether Makhanda will retain its new name or revert to Grahamstown. A full bench of three high court judges on Monday reserved judgment on the issue. One of the co-chairs of a local organization called Keep Grahamstown Grahamstown (KGG), Sigidla Ndumo, appealed against a 2019 judgment which upheld sport, art and culture minister Nathi Mthethwa’s decision to change the name of the small city. Advocate Izak Smuts, SC, for Ndumo on Monday argued that the entire process leading up to the decision to change the name from Grahamstown to Makhanda had been fatally flawed, and that the decision itself was therefore unlawful, unreasonable and irrational. The name had also caused an absurd amount of confusion, he said. “We are arguing in the Grahamstown high court situated in Makhanda in the municipality of Makana,” said Smuts to illustrate his point. Technically, the Grahamstown High Court retains that name until the Superior Courts Act is amended to reflect a different name. Both Makana and Makhanda are two different names referring to the same warrior who led a failed attack on British Forces in Grahamstown in 1819. Advocate Albert Beyleveld argued for the minister that many of the procedural issues referred to by Smuts were a “red herring”. He asked that the appeal be dismissed. Judges Elna Revelas, Mbulelo Jolwana and acting judge Lindiwe Rusi reserved judgment. DispatchLIVE
