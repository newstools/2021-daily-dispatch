French-Swiss artist Saype's impressive Beyond Walls series was unveiled on Monday morning in Sea Point, Cape Town. Saype used more than 1,000  litres of eco-friendly paint to create a unity embrace between two arms highlighting solidarity and peace across the world. Three Cape Town suburbs — Sea Point, Langa and Philippi — were used as a canvas for the French-Swiss artist whose real name is Guillaume LeGros. The event to unveil the artwork was the precursor to the International Public Art Festival planned for February. TimesLIVE
