An intelligence-led operation on the illegal occupation of land belonging to public works and infrastructure resulted in the arrest of the suspects, aged between 38 and 62, at farms located behind East London airport. “According to the information, this group of suspects was identified selling plots illegally to people,” said police spokesperson Brigadier Tembi Kinana. “Reports suggest that the group were selling the plots for R15,000 each until 31 December 2020 and R20,000 per plot from January 2021.” An undisclosed amount of money was recovered, as well as two vehicles believed to have been used by the suspects. “The suspects will be charged with fraud and other charges may be added as the investigation progresses,” said Kinana. The accused, currently in police custody, are expected to appear in the East London magistrate's court on Friday. DispatchLIVE
