The bravery of a nine-year-old girl has led to the unmasking of a suspected  serial child rapist in Daveyton, on the East Rand in Gauteng. On Friday, the girl allegedly saw a five-year-old child coming out of the 22-year-old man’s shack in Chris Hani Extension 1 and asked her what she was doing there. The child is said to have shared allegations of sexual assault with the nine-year-old, who allegedly told the little girl  she too had been abused by the man in March. The mother of the older child said a neighbour  overheard the conversation between  the two children and  reported what they had been talking about. “My daughter said she decided to confront the five-year-old because she knew the ‘uncle’ had hurt her too.”
