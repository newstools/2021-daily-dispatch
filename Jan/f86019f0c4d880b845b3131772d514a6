A liquor trader at Mdantsane Highway and another suspect have been arrested for selling alcohol in contravention of the Disaster Management Act regulations. The value of the liquor sold is R66,700. The two men, aged 38 and 39, were arrested on Wednesday. Police received information that they allegedly were selling alcohol until the early hours of the morning. "On investigating, it was established that there was evidence that liquor was being loaded into private vehicles before 5am,"  said Eastern Cape police spokesperson  Brig Tembinkosi Kinana. "After the suspects were approached as part of the investigation, the manager admitted that they had been selling  liquor to unknown persons. Subsequently, a search warrant was obtained and inside the liquor store invoices were found." The invoices showed transactions from  December 31 to January 13. All these contraventions took place while the sale and transportation of alcohol was already prohibited." The two suspects were also charged for failing to be in their residence during the stipulated hours of curfew and failing to wear face masks in the public. They will appear in the  Mdantsane magistrate's court on February 9 or face the option of paying a  R10,000 fine. Acting provincial police commissioner, major general Thembisile Patekile appreciated the work of the police. “Non-compliance remains a criminal offence in terms of the Disaster Management Act regulations and lockdown restrictions, and people who are determined to violate these laws must answer for their actions in the courts of law,” Patekile said.
